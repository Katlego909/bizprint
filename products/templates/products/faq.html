        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do your prices include VAT?</h3>
          <p>Yes, all prices displayed on our website include 15% VAT. You'll see a full breakdown including VAT on your invoice.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do you offer bulk discounts?</h3>
          <p>Yes! Our pricing automatically adjusts based on quantity. The more you order, the lower the unit price. Check the product page for quantity tiers.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I get a quote before ordering?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely! Configure your product with the specifications you need, and our instant pricing calculator will show you the exact cost. No account required to view pricing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do you have a minimum order quantity?</h3>
          <p>Minimum quantities vary by product. Most products start from as low as 5 units, but some items like banners can be ordered individually.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>💳 Payment</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
          <p>We currently accept Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). Credit card payments are coming soon. Payment must be made before production begins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I make payment?</h3>
          <p>After placing your order, you'll receive banking details via email. Transfer the amount using your order reference number. Then upload your proof of payment on the order tracking page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How long does payment verification take?</h3>
          <p>We verify payments within 2-4 hours during business hours (Monday-Friday, 8 AM - 5 PM). Payments made after hours are processed the next business day.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is it safe to upload my proof of payment?</h3>
          <p>Yes, all uploads are secure and encrypted. We only use your payment proof for verification purposes.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="category-section">
        <h2>🎨 Artwork & Files</h2>
        
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What file formats do you accept?</h3>
          <p>We accept PDF, PNG, and JPG files. PDF is preferred for the best print quality. Maximum file size is 5MB.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What resolution should my files be?</h3>
          <p>For best results, use 300 DPI (dots per inch) at the actual print size. Lower resolution may result in pixelated or blurry prints.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Should I use RGB or CMYK?</h3>
          <p>CMYK is preferred for accurate color reproduction in print. RGB colors may shift slightly when printed as they need to be converted to CMYK.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is bleed and do I need it?</h3>
          <p>Bleed is extra image area beyond the trim edge (typically 3mm on all sides). It prevents white edges if there's slight movement during cutting. We recommend including bleed for professional results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can you design for me if I don't have artwork?</h3>
          <p>Yes! We offer professional <a href="{% url 'designs:design_request_create' %}">design services</a> with various packages to suit your budget and timeline. Our designers will create custom artwork based on your brief.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Do you check my files before printing?</h3>
          <p>Yes, we perform a basic quality check. If we notice issues (low resolution, incorrect size, etc.), we'll contact you. However, you're ultimately responsible for your file's content and quality.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
